Final project for MATES Data Science 2020-2021


## Notes on Dataset
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/

The dataset in use during this project can be found at this link. 
I've attempted to upload the .csv to github to no avail, as github desktop has a maximum upload limit of 100 MB, and Github LFS has a maximum of 1 GB before they begin to charge the user.

## Notes on the Project
I created this notebook to serve as my final project for the MATES Data Science Course.

Throughout it I conduct analysis on the infamous Enron Email Dataset, which was originally obtained during investigations following the company's 2001 filing of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy.

Throughout the project I demonstrated my ability to sift through and format complicated datasets, create interesting and useful data visualizations, create network vizualizations, create word clouds, and use machine learning algorithms (specifically Natural Language Processing and K-Means Clustering).
